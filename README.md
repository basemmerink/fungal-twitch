# Fungal Twitch

Fungal Twitch is a Noita mod that lets Twitch chat pick the materials for a fungal shift.  
**Make sure to read this page carefully, all your questions should be answered here.**

## Installation

### Download

- Subscribe to it in the [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2756356482)

### Twitch
- Make 2 channel point redemptions, a template (img) can be found at the bottom of this page
  - One redemption is needed for the *from* material, and one redemption is needed for the *to* material
  - Make sure that the user must enter a message
  - Set it to not have a cooldown (you can change the cooldown settings in game)
- Create a custom command !materials which leads the viewer to https://pastebin.com/eAKLkG8u

## Starting the mod

- Start a new run in Noita with the Fungal Twitch mod enabled
- The first time you run it you need to redeem the channel point redemptions on Twitch so the mod saves them

## How it works

First the streamer picks a mode in the ingame settings, I suggest starting with Anarchy mode for optimal chaos

### Anarchy mode

Chat can redeem channel point rewards with either a *from* material or a *to* material.  
As soon as both materials are set, the fungal shift will happen.  
When a shift happens, the users that entered the materials that are used, will be put into a cooldown  
If you play with Unbalanced mode, then each person can control a shift, otherwise votes will be overriden

### Democracy mode

Chat can redeem channel point rewards with either a *from* material or a *to* material
After a set amount of time, the *from* and *to* with the highest amount of votes will be shifted

### TI mode

TI mode plays like the classic Twitch Integration.  
A random list of 4 *from* and 4 *to* materials is chosen.  
People can vote by saying 1-4 or a-d or even 1c, or 3a for example.  
After a set amount of time, the *from* and *to* with the highest amount of votes will be shifted

## Mod settings (ingame)

- *Reset twitch redeem ID's* - Toggle this if you made an error during the setup phase
- *Log a shift result ingame* - A message with the materials from the shift will be sent to the player 
- *Start with a small teleport bolt* - A small teleport bolt will be added to the players inventory on new game
- *Start with a firestone* - A Kiuaskivi will be added to the players inventory on new game
- *Start with Peace with the gods* - The player will start with the perk *Peace with the gods*
- *Start with Breathless* - The player will start with the perk *Breathless*
- *Vote mode* - Toggle between Anarchy mode, Democracy mode and TI (which acts like the classic twitch integration)
- *Unbalanced mode* - Toggle to let people fully control shifts, both from and to (anarchy only)
- *Anarchy cooldown* - The cooldown per user in seconds
- *Democracy interval* - The interval at which votes will be collected and a shift happens
- *TI interval* - The interval at which votes will be collected and a shift happens
- *Valid materials* - Toggle to ban materials

## Twitch Custom Rewards

Make one for the *from* material, and another one for *to*. I used 1 channel point as price and no cooldown, but you can obviously edit those settings as you like
